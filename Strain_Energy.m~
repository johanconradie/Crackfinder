function [ Strain_Energy_Reduction ] = Strain_Energy( stretches, Elasticity, horizon, poisson )
%Strain Energy Calculates the reduction in strain energy in each bond

% description: function takes in stretches, Young's modulus of elasticity, material horizon  and Poisson's ratio of a material
%              1) determines the micro-modulus,c , based on Gerstle et al
%              2007. Then determines the strain energy in each bond

% c = micromodulus
% W = strain energy

c = Elasticity/(3.14*horizon^3*(1-poisson);

size = length(stretches)

for i = 1:size

    W(i) = 1/2*c*stretches(i)^2
